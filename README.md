# Luxury Housing Bangalore 🏙️

## Project Overview
The Luxury Housing Bangalore project focuses on cleaning, structuring, and analyzing luxury real estate data from Bangalore. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python for data cleaning, MySQL for database management, and Power BI for data visualization.

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python libraries (Pandas and NumPy)
2. Connecting the cleaned dataset to MySQL
3. Creating database schema and tables in MySQL
4. Performing basic SQL queries for data validation and analysis
5. Connecting MySQL data to Power BI
6. Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- MySQL
- SQL
- Power BI

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to luxury housing properties in Bangalore, including property details, location and micro-market information, pricing data, infrastructure scores, connectivity scores, amenity scores, and transaction details.

## Database Design
SQL scripts used in this project are available in the `sql/` folder:
- `schema.sql` – Database and table creation

## Power BI Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Distribution of luxury properties across different micro-markets
- Ticket price comparison by locality
- Analysis of infrastructure, connectivity, and amenity scores
- Interactive filters for deeper insights

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
2. Run the Python script or notebook for data cleaning

3. Execute the SQL scripts to create the database and tables in MySQL

4. Load the MySQL data into Power BI and create visualizations
